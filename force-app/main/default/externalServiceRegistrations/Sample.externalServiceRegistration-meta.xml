        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;REST API provides you with programmatic access to your data in Salesforce. The flexibility and scalability of REST API make it an excellent choice for integrating Salesforce into your applications and for performing complex operations on a large scale. You can use REST API tools to create, manipulate, and search data in Salesforce by sending HTTP requests to endpoints in Salesforce. Depending on where you send requests, you access and operate on different pieces of information, called resources. Resources include records, query results, metadata, and more. &quot;,
